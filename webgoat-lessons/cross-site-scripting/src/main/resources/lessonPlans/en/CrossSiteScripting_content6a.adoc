== Ientify Potential for DOM-Based XSS

For this, you'll want to look for some 'test' code in the route handlers (javascript/backbone). Sometimes, test code gets left in.
(Often times test code is very simple and lacks security or any quality controls!).

Your objective is to find the route and exploit it. First though ... what is the base route? As an example, look at the URL for this lesson ...
it should look something like /WebGoat/start.mvc#lesson/CrossSiteScripting.lesson/5 (although maybe slightly different). The 'base route' in this case is:
*start.mvc#lesson/*

The *CrossSiteScripting.lesson/5* after that are parameters that are processed by javascript route handler.

So, what is test route for this test code?
