== DOM-Based XSS Scenario

DOM-based XSS is similar to reflected.  The difference is that the payload will never go to the server, but will only ever be processed by the client.

* Attacker sends a malicious URL to victim 
* Victim clicks on the link
* That link may load a malicious web page or a web page they use (are logged into?) that has a vulnerable route/handler
* If it's a  malicious web page, it may use it's own JavaScript to attack another page/url with a vulnerable route/handler
* The vulnerable page renders the payload and executes attack in the user's context on that page/site
* Attackerâ€™s malicious script may run commands with the privileges of local account

*Victim does not realize attack occurred* ... Malicious attackers don't use &lt;script&gt;alert('xss')&lt;/ script&gt;
